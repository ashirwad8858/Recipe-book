I have couple of points to discuss like I have shared some email specifically regarding the shift time overlaps backup addition of the backup resources and things like that so first of all I would like to talk about the kind of the shift timing because in the current situation to fulfill of the full full the requirement of like making sure the everything we have in the case that we can deploy as well as possible some people are working in the EST so just to provide the better overlap and complete the tickets in the same day because not all the tickets are the state forword lik jud to  deploy and promote because some of them having some priest at some time steps are not as per the kind of expectation or something is mixing which which require coordination right so that is the one problem currently facing because for fulfill those kind of requirement I have to sit back not just for the like on the release date release date could be an exception that I can totally accommodate but other than that sometimes it has to kind of specific if I would like to highlight like during the union migration task it was a Priority and couple of ticket need very kind of progressive changes sometime I was like keep working with the 745 hours just to make sure that everything we had in the parcel are in similar in the full length we can apply in all those pieces together and make ready for release fried within the short kind of period of time because we cannot accommodate like discussing on the next day next day right so that is kind of the I would say the challenge for me because I am working in the IST time zone so because we are working in a organisation where we have that certain control regulations or dates and things like that were like I have to answer what are my shift timings are management and all that things we have so because that is another option I believe team was discussing to have some kind of other shift timings like in if I will start in afternoon time and provide some kind of at least 10 to 11:00 p.m. so that covers between like both the Indian Time Zone in the EST time zone so but I will do I will talk to the account manager or asking to discuss with you whatever the solution is like the budget is a constraint then what we can do around it because I believe I don't want to put because right now in inviting and I want you to focus on the other things rather than just doing this deployment manual steps because I want to kind of take more responsibilities right and have the better control on the things and provide you the facility like the better utilisation of because there are other you have other responsibilities to pursue right so yeah we can we can think in that way but yeah I will discuss with the account manager but we can do around this but the kind of the best option we have in the current circumstances that evening shift to provide the two three hours initial to the IST time zone and then is the backup account resources because sometimes I have to plan some present time of so I need to think twice before going to the left right so if we have some resource in the backup then we have Aashirwad Aashirwad Ok Google yeah you can you can just check once and if anything like needed from the QS or side or any like details or anything like missing so we can provide that just to kind of Fastrack that thing ok another thing is providing at least the read only access to the production I think we already talked about it and I know that certain policies and things like that but just two kind of mitigate the issues like yesterday we face they have deleted from patch of right and they even kind of consider that point that they might be that that would be active on the production right and we have to have that initial cancel the previous deployment steps right we can't kind of they haven't considered that because in past that issue right when it was only specific the production Sudheer was no way for us to verify that whether it is available in the production or not so yeah axis and after that I want to bring your attention to the recent issues that we have faced one of that I already picked in the relation that is related to the connected apps where I think unable that filter right so initially the concern was related to that how the client secret for things like going to be managed are the exposing in the GitHub or not so put some R&D around that and find some kind of blocks with kids at mentioned that they are not in the current set of they are not black saving in the guitar chords are they are eliminating that peace so which is kind of safe to kind of enable that filter there are no secrets but the point is afternoon I was just kind of deployed or manually run the jobs so logically that should be the changes from the partial and the full branch and if I on the both the sandboxes in the partial I have fixed that by like deployment but in the full it was still not reflecting either option again we have to do that for department specific to that connected but I am expecting this to be resolved by just like the normal deployment because having auto deployment like we need to replicate in the same thing in the production if it is not going to work so what do you think how should I proceed so should I ask them to kind of again create some kind of PR or something like that because the changes are already there in the branches so not yes yes that so they initially they mention that they have made couple of changes out of which only the connected app changes were missing in the partial so just two kind of initially I have tried that issue and we come to the point that just to enable their testing let's make it like for deployment because we did that in the I believe if you remember right it was some specific issues so that I can relate but to fully if you had ok so you are saying that I need to create a pride deployment from partial branch to the parcel ok ok and I will filter just only that component that I want to declare that connection now ok and yeah that sounds good another is like availability for free and post steps I know because then have a lot of other responsibilities and she was helping me all song on the period implement how we should proceed because deployment steps are the most challenging part for me and we discussed earlier to kind of do some of the predefined steps on the Friday but in some cases we are not sure that changes on the Friday we have like Saturday and Sunday we so I am and I cannot evaluate that what impact is going to be on on the full environment right is it going to disable something or something is not working properly and things like that I try to discuss the same thing with the multiple developers and and the like architect over here so the feedback is both positive and negative in some cases wanted back anything but in some cases can write I also see that you have created couple of other releases so is there any specific timeline so that I can put somewhere in my notes so any action required from my side just to addition of so if I look at this one has already yeah I am clear with that party yeah yeah I was just asking about the dates of release of those that the separate releases you have created the release date and pretty much clear that if we have that other than any any fixture ICICI so it will go to the respective release price and sometimes because I remember some of them like so SL ticket something I have added in the weekly deployment because after discussion the conclusion was that the black the bundled release was delivered now we can add them to the cicd and then like fixed version option was enabled by manners and we come to the point right order to get the because it was added IPL Swift ticket is like this is not hey Google so in in your options if you so in your absence we tried to enforce a lot of rules and regulation if you see the all teams chat so sad time me and analysis we observe this so there are some certain rules and regulation of processes that you guys need to follow like I would say 60% things are pretty much take over but still now people are like doing some exer sometime Epic link is missing sometimes release version is missing they have added the post label but post steps are missing there was no change log link and things like that they are still happening but they are reduced by 67 % now so will focus they will be get better in the near future that we expect so I will try to enforce that ok and one more problem we have the last minute edition although I have specifically mentioned that by Friday Friday is the cutoff that you are going to have the relationship we take as the eastern time but people are still like messaging me or they are interesting that it is important can be do that listen that ok so and because I remember you releases back there was a ticket I have added in the last moment because I was just like member mention that it is fully ready I have verified everything and this and that I just overlook the ticket and add in the release after validation and all we found that this is depending on some other ticket which is still in the validated and I need to kind of read after the entire release so that was the kind of challenge because of that last minute edition try to enforce that the Friday cut off timeline no more edition until it is very kind of you but ideally what should happen so I believe that's all for the day I have other things like GitHub branching and all that things so we can take it for some other day I believe we are on time so I won't take not so much of your time so but thank you so much for your time great discussion so just like if you can try it as that backup account creation so that would be nice shift timing I will discuss internally with my manager and the account so we can do around this something and let you know
